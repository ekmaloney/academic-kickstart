I'm a graduate student in the Department of Sociology at Duke University. I use computational, relational, and experimental methods to investigate questions lying at the the intersections of social psychological processes of identity and emotion and political sociology. Prior to graduate school, I attended the University of Georgia, where I received BAs in Sociology and Cognitive Science.
